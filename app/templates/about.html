<h2>Anthony Munnelly</h2>
<p>
I'm on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthonymunnelly/">LinkedIn</a> and I would like a coding job. I crunch numbers and create visualisations out of the remains. I can write web apps like this one. Obviously, I suppose, as I did write this one. I <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/green-and-red-army-pray-for-an-end-to-61-years-of-hurt-1.532527">write a bit</a> of prose too. I respond positively to money.</p>

<h2>In Grateful Appreciation</h2>
